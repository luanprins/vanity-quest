                                    And for another, they reveled in having a memento of such a valiant
                                    attempt to end the source of their piety. So â€“ they took two pieces
                                    of the blade and hid it in the deepest and most unreachable reaches of
                                    this cavern's awfully perplexing tunnel system. To make sure that the
                                    blade wouldn't be repaired, they sent their slyest rogue away to hide
                                    it â€“ none but the rogue knew its location, and all swore an oath
                                    never to speak of his embarkation, for fear that information of it
                                    might later be forced out of him.'
