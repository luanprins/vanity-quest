                            into an adventurer would be so grimy?

                            'You don't look well,' says Metacy. 'The Hade tribe were so con-
                            ditioned to living in these underground systems that they're largely
                            believed to have evolved into a species different from human.'

                            Then you reach a massive room that would surely echo your
                            voice if you deemed sparing the breath for it worthwhile.

                            You are on a plateau surrounded by a river of lava coming from
                            a crack in the upper left wall.

                            Suddenly from beyond the precipice jumps a swarm of small, green
                            creatures with spears and dreadlocks.

                            'Oh, Gods,' says Metacy. 'Gorgols!'

                            They set their devilish red eyes on you without missing a beat,
                            and charge at you with their spears.

                            'Fireball them!' says Metacy.

                            From your fingers arise the most pathetic wisps of smoke you've
                            ever witnessed, rather contradictory to what you expected out of
                            your career change from apple farmer's son.

                            The Gorgols swarm you until a dozen of them covers you completely,
                            pounding fists on your flesh and ripping out bunches of hair.

                            After bruising you notably, they search your immobile, semi-unconscious
                            body for valuables, and make off with a pouch of coppers and
                            your prized silver emerald ring passed down to you by your grandfather.

                            'I'm glad you're okay,' says Metacy. 'My fireballs aren't powerful
                            enough on their own to incapacitate even a single gorgol. Only to
                            manage a less severe mischief than is the mark of their endeavours.'

                            And for the first time, you notice that you weren't the only one the
                            gorgols left bruised and beaten.

                            'Who could that be?' you say.

                            'Someone who needs help,' says Metacy.

                            On a bed of rocks on the far end of the room lies an elder woman
                            barely moving apart from breathing. You run to her side and as you
                            draw near notice the Mark of the Healer on her hand.

                            Magic healers are rare and therefore typically prized members of the
                            nobility and royal courts. But she does not have the energy left to
                            heal herself.

                            Her eyes dart to you, then to Metacy, though she does not so much look
                            'at' the fairy as 'through' her, for the fairy is visible to none but you.

                            This does not seem to stop the healer from reaching out, muttering a phrase
                            under her breath, and pulling a blue stream of energy into her body, the
                            source none other than your preternatural companion.

                            The colour returns to her face and soon she is standing.

                            'You carry a magical aura with you,' she says. 'If not for you,
                            I would have passed away for sure.'

                            'Please take this with my gratitude,' she continues. She hands you
                            the hilt end of a sword, a shard of its blade still protruding atop.
                            'I came here to slay the beast you seek, for it devoured my lover
                            into its world of eternal slumber, and I sought vengeance. But that
                            godforsaken gorgol attack made me realise something: I'm a healer, not
                            an adventurer.'

                            As a last gesture of thankfulness, she places a palm on your forehead,
                            and fills you with newfound vigour that lifts the worst of your
                            physical ailments.

                            in the river of lava in which their death by heat is redoubled.
